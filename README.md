## Paper contents

In this study, we present a new approach that integrates transcription and translation measurements to predict competition and substrate preferences within microbial communities, consequently enabling the selective manipulation of the microbiome. By performing metatranscriptomic (metaRNA-Seq) and metatranslatomic (metaRibo-Seq) analysis in complex samples, we classified microbes into functional groups (i.e. guilds) and demonstrated that members of the same guild are competitors. Furthermore, we predicted preferred substrates based on importer proteins, which specifically benefited selected microbes in the community (i.e. their niche) and simultaneously impaired their competitors.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains data and code used to analyze data and produce figures presented in the associated manuscript.  

The repository is divided in subdirectories, which follow the overall outline of the paper. Namely:  

__1. Guild-based Microbiome Classification and Prediction of Competition in a SynCom__  

This section contains code used to determine __microbial guilds__ and __predict competition__ in a 16-member synthetic community (SynCom) based on translational efficiency (TE = metaRibo-Seq / metaRNA-Seq).  
It also contains results of experimental dropout experiments used to validate predictions of competition interactions.
